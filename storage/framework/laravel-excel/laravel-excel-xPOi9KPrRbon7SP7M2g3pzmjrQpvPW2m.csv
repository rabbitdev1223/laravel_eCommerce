Cordova Standard Grain Cowhide Driver,"Cordova Safety Products grades leather according to the area on the hide from which it is cut. The premium-grade leather comes from side or shoulder and from areas higher on the animal that receive the least amount of movement.

The regular and economy cuts are selected from the middle and lower portions of the hide, making it thinner than other grades. This leather driver glove is constructed of standard grain cowhide.
